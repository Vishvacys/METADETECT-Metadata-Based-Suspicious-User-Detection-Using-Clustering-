META DETECT — AI-Powered Chat Risk Analysis Engine

META DETECT is an advanced AI system that analyzes WhatsApp and Telegram chat exports to detect suspicious communication patterns.  
It uses Context-Aware NLP, Sentiment Analysis, BERT embeddings, Network Graph Analysis, Clustering (DBSCAN + KMeans), and LSTM-based Temporal Pattern Detection.  
The tool also generates interactive dashboards, static PNG reports, and detailed JSON/CSV outputs.


FEATURES

Context-Aware NLP Detection
- Detects drug-related and suspicious keywords  
- Eliminates false positives using contextual rules  
- Sentiment-based user risk scoring  

BERT Embedding Support
- Extracts contextual embeddings  
- Automatically switches to fallback mode if BERT is unavailable  

Multi-Model Risk Evaluation
- K-Means: High / Medium / Low risk classification  
- DBSCAN: Outlier and anomaly detection  
- LSTM: Temporal behavior variance analysis  

Network Analysis (NetworkX)
- Builds chat interaction graph  
- Calculates:
  - Degree centrality  
  - Betweenness centrality  
  - PageRank  

Visual Reporting
- Interactive Plotly dashboard (HTML)  
- Static PNG dashboard  
- JSON full report  
- Detailed and summary CSV outputs
